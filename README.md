# IoT-Based-Dual-LED-Ultrasonic-Sensor-Web-Control-using-Raspberry-Pi
This project uses a Raspberry Pi to control two LEDs and monitor distance using an ultrasonic sensor, all via a Flask-based web interface. Users can turn LEDs on/off and view real-time distance measurements from anywhere using a Cloudflared tunnel, enabling remote access without port forwarding.
